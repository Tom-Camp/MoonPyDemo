# Flask MoonPy Demo

This [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/) site was built for the [CivicActions](https://www.civicactions.com) ProDev Python Sprint. The site is a basic blogging site created following the [tutorial from the Flask page](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/#tutorial) with a package added that shows the phases of the moon. The site was created simply for the purpose of learning Flask and implementing some Python3 object oriented programming.
